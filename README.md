# MyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

I used https://mocki.io/fake-json-api for a fake API, if for some reason link provided in commentsUrl doesn't work
copy-paste comments Json from src/app/data there and get new link
